## Tomorrow To-Do
1. Incorporate the RLM pipeline into the Agent Builder so that document analysis can leverage cross-agent reasoning directly from the single-agent UI.
2. Improve the UX/UI for reviewing document results (cards, summaries, KPIs) to make navigating the code insights more intuitive.
3. Investigate splitting each chapter/section into separate agents for more granular analysis and orchestrator routing.
