1. Pursuit evaluation, prioritization, and resourcing
- Assess winnability of each pursuit before committing.  
- Evaluate risk profiles (outage windows, contract terms, selection/scoring criteria).  
- Allocate resources based on winnability and risk.  
- Prioritize and pursue near-term opportunities: NYCDOT 183rd/188th St bridges (NY); MassDOT (Sagamore, Mystic River pedestrian bridge); Kishwaukee River Bridge (IL); American Legion Bridge (VA); Amtrak/Northeast Corridor projects.  
- Apply lessons learned from recent pursuits (Breakneck, Penn Station) to pursuit decisions.

2. Monitor timing, packaging, and partner constraints
- Track packaging decisions and partner exclusivity constraints so teams can be positioned appropriately.  
- Monitor timing uncertainty and provide updates for near- and mid-term pursuits (John Coffey, McKay) — projects called out: NJDOT Route 50/9W, IBX, Second Avenue Subway, Cross Bronx, Cape Cod Bridges.  

3. Teaming and contractor dynamics
- Monitor contractor teaming dynamics and revise teaming strategies accordingly.  
- Investigate alternative teaming/organizational options (including Evie hiring their team directly) and analyze financial implications for PB and group advantage.

4. Delivery models and procurement changes
- Watch for shifts in delivery models (design‑build, progressive delivery, moves back to design‑bid‑build) and adjust pursuit/delivery strategies.  
- Track evolving legislative and client preferences that could affect procurement and delivery.

5. Owner requirements and mitigation
- Address challenges from prescriptive owner requirements (notably in Massachusetts) — develop mitigation/response approaches.  
- Identify where innovative erection‑engineering methods can differentiate when requirements/scoring allow.

6. Organizational clarity and contacts
- Maintain/clarify district roles and oversight to ensure accountability (e.g., Aneela’s expanded RBLL oversight and alternate delivery network split).  
- Update org charts/contacts, incorporate recent leadership/portfolio changes, and include the new Vancouver office in pursuit planning.

7. Financial and vendor investigations (AZ core / Mass Electric / Mount Hope)
- Evaluate the AZ core proposal’s financial impact (including the potential ~$15,000,000 loss) and document concrete benefits to the group.  
- Analyze the alternative of Evie hiring their team directly, including financial implications for PB and impact on the group’s position.  
- Investigate Mass Electric concerns: review high costs, recent job losses, value delivered, and allegations it resembles a markup scheme.  
- For Mount Hope: confirm current status at A-36 and locate/identify the specific related email.

- Account for **prescriptive owner requirements** (notably Massachusetts) and **evolving legislative/client preferences** impacting procurement/delivery.

#### 2) Pursuit evaluation (go/no-go, risk, resourcing)
- Before committing to large design-build pursuits, assess **winnability, risk profile, and resource allocation** (lesson learned from Breakneck and Penn Station-related work).
- For near-term pursuits (NYCDOT 183rd/188th Street bridges; MassDOT Sagamore and Mystic River pedestrian bridge; Kishwaukee River Bridge; American Legion Bridge; Amtrak/Northeast Corridor), evaluate risks tied to:
  - **Outage windows**
  - **Contract terms**
  - **Selection criteria**
- Consider **innovative erection engineering methods** as differentiators only when **project requirements and scoring criteria** make them valuable.

#### 3) AZ core proposal / org-structure decision workstream
- **Quantify/clarify benefits** of the AZ core proposal versus the potential **~$15M loss**.
- Evaluate **Evie hiring the team directly** (and whether it benefits the group beyond PB savings).
- Further assess and address **Mass Electric concerns** by validating **actual cost/value delivered** and perceptions of excessive markup (context: recent job losses, high perceived costs).
- **Mount Hope project:** confirm it is at **A-36** and **identify/locate the specific related email** requested.
